## üéØ Quick Start - Join Files in 30 Seconds!

### 1. **Open the App** 
Simply open `index.html` in any modern browser - **no installation, no signup, no data upload!**

### 2. **Drop Multiple Files**
![Step 1: Empty App](screenshots/demo-1-empty-app.png)

![Step 2: First File](screenshots/demo-2-first-file.png)

![Step 3: Two Files Ready](screenshots/demo-3-two-files.png)

Drag and drop **multiple** CSV or Excel files. Each file instantly becomes a table (t1, t2, t3...) - **all processing happens locally!**

### 3. **Write JOIN Queries**
![Step 4: JOIN Query](screenshots/demo-4-join-query.png)

**This is where the magic happens!** Write SQL to join your files - something that normally requires a database setup:

```sql
-- üöÄ JOIN TWO FILES INSTANTLY!
SELECT 
    p.name as product_name,
    p.category,
    s.sales as sales_amount,
    s.region
FROM t1 p
JOIN t2 s ON p.id = s.product_id
ORDER BY s.sales DESC;
```

### 4. **Get Instant Results**
![Step 5: JOIN Results](screenshots/demo-5-join-results.png)

**Boom!** Your files are joined and analyzed - **all without uploading a single byte to any server!**

### 5. **Export & Share**
Download your results as CSV. Share the insights, not the sensitive data.

## üìñ Use Cases

### üîç **Data Analysis**
```sql
-- Find top-selling products by category
SELECT category, name, SUM(sales) as total_sales
FROM products p
JOIN sales s ON p.id = s.product_id
GROUP BY category, name
ORDER BY total_sales DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### üìà **Business Intelligence**
```sql
-- Calculate customer lifetime value
SELECT 
    customer_id,
    COUNT(*) as orders,
    SUM(amount) as total_spent,
    AVG(amount) as avg_order_value,
    MAX(order_date) as last_order
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING total_spent > 1000
ORDER BY total_spent DESC;
```

### üîó **Data Joining**
```sql
-- Combine data from multiple sources
SELECT 
    u.name,
    u.email,
    p.plan_name,
    COUNT(o.id) as order_count,
    SUM(o.amount) as revenue
FROM users u
LEFT JOIN plans p ON u.plan_id = p.id
LEFT JOIN orders o ON u.id = o.customer_id
GROUP BY u.name, u.email, p.plan_name
ORDER BY revenue DESC;
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

### Running Locally
```bash
# Serve the files (any static server works)
python -m http.server 8000
# or
npx serve .
```

### Taking Screenshots (Automated)
```bash
# Update all screenshots automatically (works anywhere!)
just screenshots

# Run tests with browser automation
just test

# Serve locally from project directory
just serve
```

**üéØ Fully Portable**: The automation uses `{{justfile_directory()}}` so it works immediately after cloning - no path configuration needed!

## üí° Tips & Tricks

### **File Naming**
- Use descriptive filenames - they become your table identifiers
- `sales_2024.csv` ‚Üí accessible as `sales_2024` table
- Spaces in filenames are converted to underscores

### **Performance**
- For large files (>5MB), consider splitting into smaller chunks
- Use `LIMIT` in your queries while exploring data
- Export uses the full dataset regardless of display limits

### **Modern SQL Features** 
Duck Tools supports cutting-edge SQL features that rival expensive enterprise databases:

```sql
-- ü™ü Window Functions
SELECT 
    customer_id,
    order_date,
    amount,
    SUM(amount) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY order_date) as running_total,
    LAG(amount, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY order_date) as prev_order
FROM orders;

-- üìä Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
WITH monthly_sales AS (
    SELECT 
        DATE_TRUNC('month', order_date) as month,
        SUM(amount) as total
    FROM orders
    GROUP BY month
)
SELECT month, total, total - LAG(total) OVER (ORDER BY month) as growth
FROM monthly_sales;

-- üîç Advanced Analytics
SELECT 
    product_name,
    category,
    PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY price) as median_price,
    STDDEV(price) as price_volatility,
    CORR(price, sales_volume) as price_sales_correlation
FROM products 
GROUP BY product_name, category;

-- üìÖ Date/Time Magic
SELECT 
    customer_id,
    DATE_DIFF('day', first_order, last_order) as customer_lifespan_days,
    DATE_PART('quarter', order_date) as quarter,
    DATE_FORMAT(order_date, '%Y-%m') as year_month
FROM customer_orders;
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### **File Won't Load**
1. Check file format (CSV/XLSX only)
2. Verify file isn't corrupted
3. Try converting to CSV if Excel file fails

### **Query Errors**
1. Check table names (t1, t2, t3...)
2. Verify column names match your data
3. Use `DESCRIBE t1` to see table structure

### **Performance Issues**
1. Use `LIMIT` for large result sets
2. Add appropriate `WHERE` clauses
3. Consider indexing for repeated queries
